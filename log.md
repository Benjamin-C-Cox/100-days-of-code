# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added recipe editing functionality to the recipe components.

**Thoughts**: Took me quite a while to figure out I needed to use an uncontrolled component/refs to autofill the form, but once I got that down, things went surprisingly smoothly.

### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactored recipe component to have state and made the editor togglable.

**Thoughts**: This thing's really starting to come together. I think I'll be styling it before too long.

<!-- **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app. -->

<!-- **Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. -->
