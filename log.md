# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added recipe editing functionality to the recipe components.

**Thoughts**: Took me quite a while to figure out I needed to use an uncontrolled component/refs to autofill the form, but once I got that down, things went surprisingly smoothly.

### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactored recipe component to have state and made the editor togglable.

**Thoughts**: This thing's really starting to come together. I think I'll be styling it before too long.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the addRecipe component togglable, added classNames, and started styling.

**Thoughts**: It's almost feature complete, with the exception of the accordian fxn, which will come soon. For now, let's try to make it pretty.

### Day 3: January 7, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Continued styling, mostly the recipe and ingredient list components.

**Thoughts**: Styling with react is kind of nice in the sense that components seem to lend themselves well to structured css.

### Day 4: January 8, 2017
**Today's Progress**: More styling. Turned the editor component into a modal.

**Thoughts**: Starting to look pretty decent for just having placeholder colors. I like how making a modal that closes by clicking on the grayed out parts is as simple as attaching the onCancel method.

### Day 5: January 9, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Turned addRecipe into a modal. Set groundwork for making the ingredient lists togglable.

**Thoughts**: In retrospect, I probably should have laid the groundwork for togglable ingredients in advance. It seems that it will be a bit of a pain to retrofit it. We'll call this a lesson learned.
