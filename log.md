# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added recipe editing functionality to the recipe components.

**Thoughts**: Took me quite a while to figure out I needed to use an uncontrolled component/refs to autofill the form, but once I got that down, things went surprisingly smoothly.

### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactored recipe component to have state and made the editor togglable.

**Thoughts**: This thing's really starting to come together. I think I'll be styling it before too long.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the addRecipe component togglable, added classNames, and started styling.

**Thoughts**: It's almost feature complete, with the exception of the accordian fxn, which will come soon. For now, let's try to make it pretty.
